## Intro

Initially I needed this package for getting and visualizing statistics for my normfluodbf package that was initially released on 08/25/2023. I stumbled upon [`{dgrtwo}`](https://github.com/dgrtwo/cranview/tree/master) repository with a solution to this problem and decided to make my own solution the probelm.

## Quick overview

This app allows the user to interactively explore, analyze, and visualize CRAN statistics for his/her package.

The user can also compare statistics between packages, hopefully within the same domain. Just ensure to compare oranges to oranges.

Select the **<i class="fa fa-table"></i> Analyze** tab to view and analyze CRAN statistics.

Select the **<i class="fa fa-info"></i> About** tab to view more information on the app.


## More information

This project is also a part of me improving my shiny app development and also working on app modularity.

The initial deployment of the app suffered serious performance issues and this iteration of the product has shown my knowledge improvement with an app that is probably 10x more performance.

The App has no affiliation to RStudio or CRAN. Some packages might not be present, don't feel snubbed.

## Epilogue

Dont ask me anything. Enjoy the App!
