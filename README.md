## CranQuery
- - A beefed up version of cranview from. Visit https://github.com/dgrtwo/cranview/tree/master for the source of the inspiration for this project.
- - This project is a good part of the R curriculum for newbies and as it was for myself. I showcase the use of several tools as I extend knowledge from my API intro repository https://github.com/AlphaPrime7/api_intro.
- - This project is perfect recipe for trusting the process.
  - I will attempt a landing page but I do not really fancy that. The application and logic seem just fine and improvements are welcomed.
