- A beefed up version of cranview from. Visit [`{my link}`](https://alphaprime7.shinyapps.io/cranQuery/) to use the app conveniently. This is my first published shiny app.
- The next task will be implementing smoothing of the time series especially for the daily view.
- This project is a good part of the R curriculum for newbies and as it was for myself. I showcase the use of several tools as I extend knowledge from my API intro repository [`{api_intro repository}`](https://github.com/AlphaPrime7/api_intro).
- This project is perfect recipe for trusting the process.
- I will attempt a landing page but I do not really fancy that. The application and logic seem just fine and improvements are welcomed.
